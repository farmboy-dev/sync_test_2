Thanos Sidecar:
The Thanos Sidecar is added to existing Prometheus servers to persistently store their data in Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage). This enables backup of Prometheus server data and sharing of data across multiple Prometheus servers.

Thanos Querier:
The Thanos Querier consolidates and queries data collected from multiple Prometheus servers. When a query is executed, the Thanos Querier combines data from Prometheus servers and Object Storage to generate a unified response.

Thanos Store Gateway:
The Thanos Store Gateway reads data stored in Object Storage and responds to queries from Prometheus servers. This allows a central querying service (Querier) to query not only Prometheus server data but also data stored in Object Storage.

Thanos Ruler:
The Thanos Ruler performs functions similar to the existing Prometheus Alertmanager. It evaluates and manages rules and alerts, forwarding results to the Alertmanager for alert processing and notifications.

Thanos Compactor:
The Thanos Compactor continuously optimizes and merges data in Object Storage, addressing the growing size of stored data. This helps optimize data size in the long term.

Prometheus Server:

The core component responsible for collecting and storing time-series data. It uses a pull-based model to scrape metrics from configured targets and stores the data locally.
Prometheus Storage:

Manages the local storage of time-series data collected by the Prometheus server. Data is stored in a time-series database, making it efficient for querying historical metrics.
Prometheus Query Language (PromQL):

A powerful query language used to retrieve and analyze time-series data stored in Prometheus. PromQL allows users to perform complex queries and aggregations.
Alertmanager:

Manages and processes alerts generated by Prometheus. It allows users to define alerting rules and handles the routing and notification of alerts to various channels (e.g., email, Slack).
Exporters:

Specialized components that expose metrics from third-party systems in a format Prometheus can scrape. Exporters enable Prometheus to monitor diverse applications and services.
Node Exporter:

A commonly used exporter for collecting system-level metrics from hosts, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network statistics.
Pushgateway:

Allows short-lived jobs or batch processes to push metrics to Prometheus. This is useful for scenarios where the usual pull-based model isn't suitable.
